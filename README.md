# mysql
'mysql' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file...

Step 3: Search Drive
Type the command dir mysqld.exe /s /p on the command prompt.

It will search your directories and will list the directory where mysqld.exe is located.

Step 4: Change Directory
Now once again change your command prompt file location to the folder where your mysqld.exe is located. In my case it is located here in folder C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin hence I will run following command: cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.6\bin .
